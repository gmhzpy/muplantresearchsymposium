Blake Meyers is a Member & Principal Investigator at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center in St. Louis, and he is a Professor in the Division of Plant Science and Technology at the University of Missouri - Columbia. He formerly held the Edward F. and Elizabeth Goodman Rosenberg professorship at the University of Delaware, where his research group was from 2002 to 2015. He was elected as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in 2012, and a Fellow of the American Society of Plant Biologists (ASPB) in 2017, the same year he was awarded the Charles Albert Shull Award by the ASPB for outstanding investigations in the field of plant biology. He was elected to the US National Academy of Sciences in 2022. After serving on the editorial board since 2008, Blake became the Editor-in-Chief of The Plant Cell in January 2020. Work in his lab addresses the biological functions, biogenesis, genomic impact, and evolution of small RNAs in diverse plant species, using combination of genomic and molecular genetics approaches, with a focus on phased, secondary siRNAs (“phasiRNAs”).

Dr. Tim Kelliher has a B.A in Biology from Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania. During college he studied leaf cell fate specification under Professor Scott Poethig and Dr. Stuart Gillmor at the University of Pennsylvania, and then studied germinal cell fate acquisition in Drosophila under Professor Steven DiNardo.  He has a Ph.D. in Biology from Stanford University, where he studied with Professor Virginia Walbot the topic of reproductive cell fate specification in maize. He joined Syngenta in 2013 and cloned the haploid inducer gene in maize MATRILINEAL and used this gene to developed haploid induction in rice and other crops. He then developed a method of elite germplasm editing while producing non-transgenic doubled haploids (HI-Edit). He is a Science Fellow at Syngenta and run the Breeding Technology Group in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina and he is a science leader of two research programs (Genome Editing Application Technologies, and New Innovation).

## Dr. Jessica Rutkoski <br/>
#### *Assistant Professor, Crop Sciences Department, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign* <br/>

Dr. Jessica Rutkoski is a small grains breeder and a quantitative geneticist with a passion for putting the principles and techniques of quantitative genetics and statistics to use in applied breeding in order to accelerate rates of genetic gain in ways that benefit people and the environment. Jessica’s main goals are to a) develop winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) varieties that will help improve the profitability of wheat production in Illinois and surrounding states, b) improve levels of quantitative disease resistance in small grains, and c) develop and deploy new breeding methods to accelerate rates of genetic gain in wheat and other self-pollinated crops.
Dr. Jessica Rutkoski received her Bachelor’s of Science degree in Genetics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2009 and then went on to get her Ph.D. at Cornell University under the direction of Small Grains Breeder Dr. Mark Sorrells.  In 2014, Jessica completed her Ph.D. and then continued on at Cornell University as an assistant professor where her mission was to innovate and transfer advanced breeding methods like genomic selection to wheat breeding programs globally. In doing so, Jessica conducted her research in collaboration with the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), headquartered in Mexico, where she worked as an Adjunct Associate Scientist in the Global Wheat Breeding Program. In pursuit of new challenges and broader impact, in 2016, Dr. Rutkoski began working as a Scientist in the plant breeding division at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), located in the Philippines. Jessica’s role at IRRI was to improve rice breeding efficiency through more effective use of data and analytical techniques.
